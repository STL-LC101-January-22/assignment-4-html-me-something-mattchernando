      <h1>The Story of A Prince</h1>
      <h2 id="mainHeading">In West Philadelphia born and raised...</h2>
      <p>the playground was where I spent most of my days
      <br>Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
      <br>And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
      <br>When a couple of guys who were up to no good
      <br>Started making trouble in my neighborhood
      <br>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared said,
      <br>You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!

     <testP>But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
      <br>She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket 
      <br>I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" </testP></div>
